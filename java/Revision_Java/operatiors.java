        // The assignment operator are used to assign value to the different variable we can equal to operator to assign value to the variable. syntax to assignment operator in java.
        // the assignment operatiors are +=, -=, /=, %= etc are assignment operations
        // data_type variablename = value;

        // relational operations: the relational operatiors are used to perform relation on operands the relation operator is used to compare number 
        // the relation operands are less then,greater then, equal to, not equal to etc.
          
        // System.out.println(3 > 4);
        // System.out.println(4 > 3);
        // System.out.println(3 == 3);

        // bitwise operator : the bitwise operator are used to perform bit level operation on operand for eg bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise not etc.
          
        // Ternary operator: it is shortcut of if statement. if condition is true then first statement executed otherwise other statement execute.
        // syntaxt:
        //   condition ? statement 1: statement 2;
        //   if condition is true the statement 1 will be executed.
        //   if condition is false then the statement 2 will be executed;


        // logical operator : the logical operator are used to perform logic to our code. there are many type the most used logical operators are
        // and : if both condition is true the and block will be execute. syntax:
        //   System.out.println(3 > 4 && 3 < 4);
        //    or : if only one condition is true then the block code will be executed
